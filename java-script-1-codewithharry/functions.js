// function in java-script--
function Avg(x,y){
    return (x+y/2)
}

const sum = (p,q) =>{
    return p+q
}
// functions stop


// this is the example of to use before the function--
let a=1
let b=2
let c=3

console.log("The avg of a and b id :",Avg(a,b))
console.log("The avg of a and c id :",Avg(b,c))
console.log("The avg of b and c id :",Avg(c,a))
console.log("The sum of a and b :",sum(a,b))


// overcomes his problem repeating problem by function--
